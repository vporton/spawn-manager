* Rewrite without GNAT.Expect (1. to increase portability; 2. to use fork()
  directly because we need to dup2() stdin/stdout in child process; 3. to
  increase performance). Regular Spawn does not do this.

* Use some unbounded string stream (where to get? write a new one?)
  The buffer of the string stream should be wrapped with a higher level
  packet, because it may be read as more than one recv() operation.
  Then implement asynchronous(?) communication with child process.

Unbounded in-memory streams (choose one):
