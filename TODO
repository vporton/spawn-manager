* Use some unbounded string stream (where to get? write a new one?)
  The buffer of the string stream should be wrapped with a higher level
  packet, because it may be read as more than one recv() operation.
  Then implement asynchronous(?) communication with child process.

* Refuse to use SIGINT, use SIGTERM?
