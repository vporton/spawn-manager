Ada Spawn Manager
=================

The Ada spawn manager implements the concept described in the GNAT GPL
package System.OS_Lib. It is used to solve the problem of spawning
processes at arbitrary times from multitasking Ada programs:

[quote, GNAT COMPILER COMPONENTS, SYSTEM.OS_LIB specification]
____
If the parent is using tasking, and needs to spawn subprocesses at arbitrary
times, one technique is for the parent to spawn (very early) a particular
spawn-manager subprocess whose job is to spawn other processes. The
spawn-manager avoids tasking. The parent sends messages to the spawn-manager
requesting it to spawn processes, using whatever inter-process communication
mechanism you like, such as sockets.
____

The Ada spawn manager uses UNIX domain sockets provided by the Anet library to
implement fast and simple IPC.
